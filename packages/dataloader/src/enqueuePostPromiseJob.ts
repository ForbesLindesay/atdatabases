// Private: Enqueue a Job to be executed after all "PromiseJobs" Jobs.
//
// ES6 JavaScript uses the concepts Job and JobQueue to schedule work to occur
// after the current execution context has completed:
// http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-jobs-and-job-queues
//
// Node.js uses the `process.nextTick` mechanism to implement the concept of a
// Job, maintaining a global FIFO JobQueue for all Jobs, which is flushed after
// the current call stack ends.
//
// When calling `then` on a Promise, it enqueues a Job on a specific
// "PromiseJobs" JobQueue which is flushed in Node as a single Job on the
// global JobQueue.
//
// DataLoader batches all loads which occur in a single frame of execution, but
// should include in the batch all loads which occur during the flushing of the
// "PromiseJobs" JobQueue after that same execution frame.
//
// In order to avoid the DataLoader dispatch Job occuring before "PromiseJobs",
// A Promise Job is created with the sole purpose of enqueuing a global Job,
// ensuring that it always occurs after "PromiseJobs" ends.
//
// Node.js's job queue is unique. Browsers do not have an equivalent mechanism
// for enqueuing a job to be performed after promise microtasks and before the
// next macrotask. For browser environments, a macrotask is used (via
// setImmediate or setTimeout) at a potential performance penalty.
